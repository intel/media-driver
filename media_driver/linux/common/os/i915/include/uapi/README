This directory contains a copy of the installed kernel headers
required by the iHD driver to communicate with the kernel.
Whenever driver needs new definitions for new kernel
APIs, these files should be updated.

These files in master should only be updated once the changes have landed
in the drm-next repo, https://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/drm/drm.git.

The last update was done at the following kernel commit :

commit 9235dd441af43599b9cdcce599a3da4083fcad3c
