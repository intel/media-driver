This directory contains a copy of the installed kernel headers
required by the iHD driver to communicate with the kernel.
Whenever driver needs new definitions for new kernel
APIs, these files should be updated.

These files in master should only be updated once the changes have landed
in the drm-next tree (see https://cgit.freedesktop.org/drm/drm/).

You can copy files installed after running this from the kernel
repository, at version the driver require:

$ make headers_install INSTALL_HDR_PATH=/path/to/install

The last update was done at the following kernel commit :

    drm/virtio: do NOT reuse resource ids

    Bisected guest kernel changes crashing qemu.  Landed at
    "6c1cd97bda drm/virtio: fix resource id handling".  Looked again, and
    noticed we where not only leaking *some* ids, but *all* ids.  The old
    code never ever called virtio_gpu_resource_id_put().

    So, commit 6c1cd97bda effectively makes the linux kernel starting
    re-using IDs after releasing them, and apparently virglrenderer can't
    deal with that.  Oops.

    This patch puts a temporary stopgap into place for the 5.0 release.
