    //!           1: if available pool has command buffer and its size bigger than
    //!              required, directly put it into in use pool and return;
    //!           2: if available pool has command buffer but size smaller than
    //!              required, only create one command buffer as reqired and put
    //!              it to in  use pool directly;
    //!           3: if available pool is empty, will re-allocate bunch of command
    //!              buffers, buffer number base on m_initBufNum, buffer size
    //!              base on input required size. After re-allocate, put first buf
    //!              into inuse pool, remains push to available pool.

    //!           from in use pool and push it to available pool. If the command
