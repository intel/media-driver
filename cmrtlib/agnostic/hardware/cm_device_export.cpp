//! \brief      Enqueue a task
//! \details    Enqueues a task represented by CmTask.
//!             The kernels in the CmTask object may be run concurrently.
//!             Each task can have up to CAP_KERNEL_COUNT_PER_TASK kernels.
//!             Tasks are executed according to the order they
//!             were enqueued. The next task will not start execution until
//!             the current task finishes. 
//!             This is a nonblocking call. i.e. it returns immediately 
//!             without waiting for GPU to start or finish execution of the
//!             task. A CmEvent is generated each time a task is enqueued.
//!             The CmEvent can be used to check the status or other data
//!             regarding the task execution. The generated event needs to
//!             be managed and released by the user. 
//!             To avoid generating an event, the user can set the event 
//!             as CM_NO_EVENT and pass it to this function.
//! \param      [in] queue
//!             Pointer to the CmQueue
//! \param      [in] task
//!             Pointer to the CmTask
//! \param      [out] event
//!             Reference to the pointer for the CmEvent to be created
//! \param      [in] threadSpace
//!             Pointer to the thread space
//! \retval     CM_SUCCESS            if task successfully enqueued
//! \retval     CM_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY if out of host memory
//! \retval     CM_FAILURE            otherwise
